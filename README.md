# PHP Server Environment ðŸ’»<!-- omit in toc -->

> In this project we learnt how to explore the content of the variable $_SERVER which is injected to the running script, in it we can find information about the server environment and the client as well as creating a simple login form that validates the inputs, throws alerts for different cases and that can logout successfully.
For this I used session_start() to maintain the variables as well as: unset($_SESSION), session_destroy() and session_write_close() to logout. 

I also used Bootstrap to create a simple and beautiful layout and desing.
