## How to create users

You could create Users in the folder 'app/resources/users.php/.

You must need to create a new array at the bottom of the $user variable. It's important to follow the next structure:

- Must assign the key "user" to the new username and the your custom user.
- Must assign the key "pass" in the same array of the new user.

If you don't accomplish this instructions your user won't work.

## Bootstrap Panel

You could change the panel, since the page it's based on a bootstrap template.
